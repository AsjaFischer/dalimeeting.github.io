title:  "Uncovering the structure of complex data: progresses in machine learning and causal inference"
abstract: "Inferring a systemâ€™s underlying mechanisms is a primary goal in many areas of science. For instance, understanding cause-effect relationships is necessary if one wants to intervene on the system in order to improve its performance. In this context, scientists often need to be able to draw causal interpretations from complex, real-world data.
Causal inference and structural equation models provide a rigorous framework to address these questions. However, the validity of these approaches may be challenged by complex structures involving non-stationarity, non-linearity or high-dimensionality. In particular, these properties frequently occur in natural or artificial systems resulting from interactions between many interdependent parts, such as biological or social networks.
This workshop will discuss recent progresses in causal inference and related approaches to deal with data of increasing complexity. It aims at bringing together researchers from various fields to discuss the current challenges in estimating mechanisms from real-world data."

  abstract: "Causal graphical model structure discovery is a challenging part of causal inference, graphical model research and machine learning. If absence of latent confounders can be assumed, the tool of choice are exact score-based methods, as they provably find the globally optimal equivalence class of structures. Constraint-based methods on the other hand are able to handle more general model spaces with cycles and latent confounders, but offer seriously poorer accuracy. We present research that bridges this gap between constraint-based and score-based methods to some extent. We use a combination of score-based and constraint-based ideas together with Boolean (maximum) satisfiability solving, to obtain an approach that retains exactness and the generality of the model space."
