title:  "Uncovering the structure of complex data: progresses in machine learning and causal inference"
abstract: "Inferring a systemâ€™s underlying mechanisms is a primary goal in many areas of science. For instance, understanding cause-effect relationships is necessary if one wants to intervene on the system in order to improve its performance. In this context, scientists often need to be able to draw causal interpretations from complex, real-world data.
Causal inference and structural equation models provide a rigorous framework to address these questions. However, the validity of these approaches may be challenged by complex structures involving non-stationarity, non-linearity or high-dimensionality. In particular, these properties frequently occur in natural or artificial systems resulting from interactions between many interdependent parts, such as biological or social networks.
This workshop will discuss recent progresses in causal inference and related approaches to deal with data of increasing complexity. It aims at bringing together researchers from various fields to discuss the current challenges in estimating mechanisms from real-world data."

  abstract: "Causal graphical model structure discovery is a challenging part of causal inference, graphical model research and machine learning. If absence of latent confounders can be assumed, the tool of choice are exact score-based methods, as they provably find the globally optimal equivalence class of structures. Constraint-based methods on the other hand are able to handle more general model spaces with cycles and latent confounders, but offer seriously poorer accuracy. We present research that bridges this gap between constraint-based and score-based methods to some extent. We use a combination of score-based and constraint-based ideas together with Boolean (maximum) satisfiability solving, to obtain an approach that retains exactness and the generality of the model space."

  abstract: "Time series data and data collected across different conditions often exhibit a distribution shift phenomenon, which poses challenges for both causal discovery and prediction -- the underlying causal model may change with the distribution shift, and traditional supervised learning assumes that the training set and test set were drawn from the same distribution, which is not the case when the data distribution changes. In this talk, we emphasize and exploit the coupling relationship between causal modeling and distribution shift: causal models imply how the data-generating processes or different modules of the joint distribution may change, and distribution shift actually exhibits such changes. Accordingly, we show how causal discovery could benefit from distribution shift, and how a causal perspective helps understand and solve the problem of domain adaptation or transfer learning."

  abstract: "Single Cell biological data, and particularly Mass Cytometry Data present significant opportunities not only for discovering novel biological data, but also for serving as a testbed of Causal Discovery algorithms. Such data seem ideal for Causal Discovery as they typically contain thousands of even millions of sample points, under several experimental conditions, and often measured at several time points. On the other hand, initial attempts at Causal Discovery demonstrate the challenges of learning causality in the microworld where confounding factors and feedback cycles are abundant. In this talk, we present approaches developed and applied on mass cytometry data that are based on Causal Probabilistic Graphical Models as well as novel approaches based on Ordinary Differential Equation Models. The results and the lesson's learnt will be discussed, as well as their influence in inventing new methods that can robustly discover causality in single cell biological data."
