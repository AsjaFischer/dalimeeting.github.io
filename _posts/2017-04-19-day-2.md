    institute: Microsoft Research Cambridge
  abstract: "In the last three years powerful probabilistic deep learning models
have been developed: the variational autoencoder,
generative-adversarial networks, and maximum mean discrepancy models.
These models provide tractable-by-design inference approximations at
test-time and can be learned efficiently.  I will present some work
from my group, and also briefly survey the larger progress made in
combining probabilistic models with deep learning, including a summary
of open research questions."

  abstract: "
In recent years a number of large-scale triple-oriented knowledge graphs have been generated. They are being used in research and in applications to support search, text understanding and question answering.  Knowledge graphs pose new challenges for machine learning and research groups have developed novel statistical models that can be used to compress knowledge graphs, to derive implicit facts, to detect errors,  and to support the above mentioned applications. Some of the most successful  statistical models are based on  tensor decompositions that use latent representations of the involved generalized entities. In my talk I will address the question if these models might also provide insight into the brain's memory system.  In particular we discuss how episodic memory, semantic memory and perception are all mutually dependent."
