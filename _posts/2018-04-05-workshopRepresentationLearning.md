title:  "Goals and Principles of Representation Learning"
layout: multitrack
abstract: "Deep learning has driven a revolution in several areas of machine
learning, thanks to a large degree to their ability to discover rich
and useful representations from data. Despite these empirical
successes, especially in supervised learning, significant open
questions remain about the computational goal of unsupervised and
semi-supervised representation learning.

How can we characterise the goal of unsupervised representation
learning? What criteria should one use to evaluate and compare
different data representations? Are maximum likelihood, variational
inference, information bottleneck or hierarchical Bayesian models
fundamentally fit for this purpose and if so, why? Is representation
learning a fundamental problem, or an epiphenomenon of other perhaps
more fundamental tasks, such as transfer learning and data-efficiency.
The goal of this workshop is to explore the recent efforts in
representation learning related, such as disentangling factors of
variation, manifold learning, and transfer learning; the role of prior
knowledge, structure, sparsity, invariances, and smoothness; and  and
the role of representation in problems in reinforcement learning,
natural language, and scene understanding. We shall bring together
machine learning researchers with different views on these questions
to stimulate further discussion and progress."
