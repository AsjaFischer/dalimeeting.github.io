title:  "The Data Science Process"
abstract:  "This workshop aims to cover the following main topics related to the data process pipeline: </br>  </br> 1) Open challenges in data science: The gap between machine learning techniques and how to apply them in real-world data. Which problems do scientists still face when trying to use ML techniques?
 </br> 2) Collaboration: How do you collaborate on building Machine Learning Models/Systems?
 </br> 3) Automation of Data Science: Current efforts that the ML community is doing to address these challenges. Tools that are being developed to ease the data science process including among others probabilistic programming, automating model selection, automating pipeline construction."

  speaker: Data challenges with modularization and code submission
  youtube: 
  start: 9:00
  end: 10:15
  abstract: Motivated by the shortcomings of traditional data challenges, we have developed a unique concept and platform, called Rapid Analytics and Model Prototyping (RAMP), based on modularization and code submission. Open code submission allows participants to build on each other’s ideas, provides the organizers with a fully functioning prototype, and makes it possible to build complex machine learning workflows while keeping the contributions simple. We will start this presentation by describing the context and motivation, the guiding design principles, and some of the technical details (front and backend) of the platform. We will then walk you through some of the most interesting workflows and applications (e.g., anomaly detection in particle physics detectors, classifying molecular spectra for safe drug administration, spatio-temporal time series prediction in climate science). In the last third of the talk we will present a preliminary analysis of the RAMPs that touches on both the technical (machine learning) aspects of the tool and on the sociology of crowdsourcing data analytics.

  speaker: Closing the loop in recommender systems
  youtube: 
  start: 10:15
  end: 11:00
  abstract: In this talk I will walk through a brief history of recommender system implementations in YouTube, iOS Proactive Assistant, and Facebook Newsfeed.  One key challenge in all of these products is that models are learning from a dataset and updating the same dataset simultaneously. I'll discuss a set of issues that arise from these dynamics and ways to address these issues, including an introduction to deep reinforcement learning.

  end: 12:15
  abstract: In this talk we will focus on challenges in facilitating the data science pipeline. Drawing on experience from projects in computational biology, the developing world and Amazon I’ll propose different ideas for facilitating the data science process including analogies that help software engineers understand the challenges for data science and formalizations, such as data readiness levels, which allow management to reason about the obstacles in the process.
