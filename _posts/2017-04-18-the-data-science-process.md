title:  "The Data Science Process"
abstract:  "This workshop aims to cover the following main topics related to the data process pipeline: </br> 1) Open challenges in data science: The gap between machine learning techniques and how to apply them in real-world data. Which problems do scientists still face when trying to use ML techniques?
 </br> 2) Collaboration: how do you collaborate on building Machine Learning Models/Systems?
 </br> 3) Automation of Data Science: Current efforts that the ML community is doing to address these challenges. Tools that are being developed to ease the data science process including among others probabilistic programming, automating model selection, automating pipeline construction."

  abstract: In this talk we will focus on challenges in facilitating the data science pipeline. Drawing on experience from projects in computational biology, the developing world and Amazon Iâ€™ll propose different ideas for facilitating the data science process including analogies that help software engineers understand the challenges for data science and formalizations, such as data readiness levels, which allow management to reason about the obstacles in the process.
