title:  "Fairness and Privacy in Machine Learning"
abstract:  "The advent of machine learning applications in crucial decision-making processes including law, medicine, banking and education raises a number of important issues with technical and societal ramifications. Driven by these concerns, a growing body of research addresses questions related to fairness, bias, privacy and interpretability in machine learning and artificial intelligence. A fundamental problem in this area is devising formal definitions of these concepts that match the intuitions and properties that users expect from a fair/private/unbiased/interpretable system. Among these, fairness and privacy have seen important success in recent years with the proposal and adoption of definitions that can now be used to certify that machine learning algorithms make fair predictions or respect the privacy of the users in the training dataset.
</br>

This workshop will gather experts in fairness and privacy in machine learning with the goal of discussing the latest technical advances in the area. Additionally, the workshop will serve as a platform to highlight application domains with a pressing need for fairness and privacy technologies. The program also includes a panel discussion where speakers and attendees will have a chance to explore the challenges involved in deploying such technologies and brainstorm about the impact that research in these areas will have in our society."
